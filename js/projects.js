        text: "The project deals thematically with the social isolation of older people and the associated informal care work, which is often done in private. Through a new form of retirement centre, as a ‘self-care day centre’, care is brought into the public eye and the hierarchy between carers and those being cared for is disolved. The day centre has found a home in an empty carpentry workshop on Rheinstrasse in Frenkendorf, Basel. The building has high spatial qualities and is well maintained, but requires infrastructural interventions and barrier-free access. This will be achieved by adding a new volume orthogonal to the gabled roofs, which connects the three existing parts of the building. All installations are routed along the new structure from the PV roof to the heat pump and from the heat pump to the heating systems. These are designed as thermally activated components and are modelled on classic tiled stoves. These ‘ovens’ give the building are thermal structure and create warm zones around which the communal activities group."
