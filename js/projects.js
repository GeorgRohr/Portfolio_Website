        text: "The project deals thematically with the social isolation of older people and the associated informal care work, which is often done in private. Through a new form of retirement centre, as a ‘self-care day centre’, care is brought into the public eye and the hierarchy between carers and those being cared for is disolved. The day centre has found a home in an empty carpentry workshop on Rheinstrasse in Frenkendorf, Basel. The building has high spatial qualities and is well maintained, but requires infrastructural interventions and barrier-free access. This will be achieved by adding a new volume orthogonal to the gabled roofs, which connects the three existing parts of the building. All installations are routed along the new structure from the PV roof to the heat pump and from the heat pump to the heating systems. These are designed as thermally activated components and are modelled on classic tiled stoves. These ‘ovens’ give the building are thermal structure and create warm zones around which the communal activities group."

        text: `This is a project for humans to learn to forgo as only then we believe we can regain imagination. All our solutions for today’s crisis put us humans first. We don’t want to give up on comfort and our ways of living established. However, it has been this self focus that brought us to this critical point. We have lost the ability to abstain and to give up control on parts of nature. The proposal “Peirasmos” is making us aware of our self-centredness by confronting us with a self-sustaining, but forever closed habitat, which we can never reach or profit from. This project is about abstinence in order for the planet to regenerate as it depicts a new type of nature, one that goes beyond what you can see, touch or profit from. Within the icosahedron-shaped sphere, a bioactive terrarium is estabWithin established. Through the interplay of photosynthesis, transpiration, condenlished. condensation and decomposition, the plants grow and flourish without an insation intervention of us humans. While we could stand and move within the tervention inside space, the moment we breach the membrane, the ecosystem is destroyed. Increasing the notion of fragility, the membrane expands and retracts with the different air temperatures, visualizing the living and changing inside. Condensation on the inside of the membrane blurs the view to the habitat, reducing the human-gaze on nature as an object of beauty. At this point, the human curiosity is arriving at its climax, pushing one to break the membrane, uncovering the mystery of the inside and to sin.`

        text: `A rediscovery of solid stone as statically effective construction is at the core of this project. It proposes a new masonry system made of L-shaped stones. These form a woven, force-fit masonry by interlocking with horizontal stone beams. The short side of the ‘L’ protrudes from the masonry and serves as a console for secondary timber constructions. A series of stone walls made of this masonry form a large urban form, which, like a sponge, can flexibly accommodate the secondary structure. Two walls each contain a Nuclei. This is the basic building block and functions as an independent flat. From this, residents can add further rooms and balconies according to their needs. In this way, the individually built homes can vary over time, while the stone walls serve as a permanent structure.`

being demolished in 2026. The studio searched for alternatives to this scenario,
re-visiting the potential of the building and proposing a future for it. The project introduces
a garment factory in the shed hall, creating missing workplaces in manual labour
and establishing a link between the industry and the public. The interventions
are always starting from the existing layers of usage, history and meaning, adding
new layers only where it is necessary and in a way that keeps the old ones present.`

        text: `The Augustenstrasse in Munich holds the potential of a building extension by five meters, as the buildings don‘t fill the whole plot to the street. The studio investigated which potentials could be unlocked, by introducing an arcade on the ground floor. In the project, the arcade is built first, as an independent entity, allowing the extensions of each houses to happen detached from each other. In the design of the new floorplans and facades, the focus lay therefore on the individual potential of each house and to take preserve it in the extension.`

        text: `The competition asked for a new construction, replacing the old Kiosk situated on
the Stadthausanlage, next to the Bürkliquai in Zurich.
The project proposes a folding form that splits the program onto two volumes. Due
to the program, most of the facade has no windows. The facade is therefore constructed
and used as a „Bulletin Board“, a public wall on which people can put up advertisements,
notices and posters, extending the notion of a Kiosk as an important
meeting point and provider of basic goods within everyday life.`
